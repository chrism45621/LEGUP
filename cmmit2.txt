10/21 Commit: I implemented the TooFewBlackCellsContradictionRuleTest for the fillapix puzzle. This rule was similar to the toomanyblackcells rule, so it was not too hard to figure out how to implement this. In addition to the test case code, I also added multiple test grids to add to the project and to be able to use these grids to test the code. This contradiction rule is a rule in fillapix that detects if there are not enough black cells surrounding a certain numbered cell. I implemented specific test cases to be able to test that this contradiction rule is working properly. The first type of test I did was having a 3 in the center and only 2 black cells surrounding it, meaning there is not enough. Another test I did was a 3 in the corner and only 2 surrounding black cells, so again there is not enough. I checked the location of each grid to ensure that the contradiction rule works as stated. It passed the tests, so I knew I completed it. For the test grids I added, I created specific scenarios which would be good for testing this rule.
