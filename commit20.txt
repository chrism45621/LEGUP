This test grid is for the satisfyclue case rule test case for the Fillapix puzzle. The satisfyclue rule just creates different branches for each case to solve a clue. To satisfy the clue, the clue must touch the same number of black cells as the number it has. This clue will only generate branches if there are 5 or less cases. First, I implemented the test case code to ensure that the satisfyclue case rule was working properly. I used this test grid to verify the code works. This test grid has a numbered cell of 2 in the middle of the grid, and then there are other black cells surrounding it. This test grid allowed the test code to efficiently test if the case rule was working as it should.
