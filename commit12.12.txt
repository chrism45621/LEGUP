12/12 Commit: I implemented the FinishWithBlackDirectRule test case for the Fillapix puzzle. This direct rules imply checks if all unknown cells added to black cells touching a certain numbered cell is equal. So, I wrote a test case on this rule to ensure that it is working and valid. I implemented 3 kinds of tests which ran through different possible scenarios. For each puzzle, I generated a board and set one of the cells to be black. Then, for each test, I looped through the entire grid and checked every cell. I made sure the cells were in the proper state for the given grid. The first grid has one black cell and one numbered cell 1. Another test I coded had 4 black cells, and there was one numbered cell as 4. The last type of test I did was a 3x3 test grid. There were 8 black cells, and one numbered cell in the middle numbered as 8. These passed the test cases, which proved that this direct rule works as it should.
