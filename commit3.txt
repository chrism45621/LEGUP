11/7 Commit: I implemented the FillapixTileData and FillapixTileType file for the Fillapix puzzle. I noticed that for Fillapix, there weren't specific functions that could describe the status of cells easily. I saw other puzzles such as Nurikabe had this ability, so I decided to implement these files to make it easier for myself and for future developers. FillapixTileType is a small helper class that just returns the status of the cell, so unset, white, black, or number. FillapixTileData was a way larger file that used the tile types to help. I used the tiletype file to help construct the Fillapix objects with their correct type and data. I also added another constructor to allow it to take in other Fillapix types. I also added functions that returned its type, and Boolean functions that checked if a fillapix cell is a certain type. I was also able to add a function that allowed it to compare itself to other Fillapix cells. Overall, these files made it a lot easier to continue development with the Fillapix puzzle.
