11/18 commit: I implemented the SatisfyClueCaseRuleTest. This was quite a tricky test case to pull off. This rule requires a numbered cell to be touching that many black cells currently, and then creates different cases where moves can be made. I first started off by making a general fillapix board. It can only generate less than 5 grids, so I then made 3 more grids to use. For each grid, I collected the data of a certain cell, whether it was black, white, or unset. At certain positions, I then made sure that they had the same values as the other grids when applicable. I also made sure they all had the same dimensions to make sure there was no error, and I checked they were not the exact same grid. I then looped through the board cell by cell. I then tested to make sure that the caseboards had the same details. This helped confirm that the satisfycluecaserule works properly.
