10/14 Commit: I implemented the TooManyBlackCellsContradictionRuleTest for the Fillapix puzzle. I also implemented multiple test grids for this test case. TooManyBlackCellsContradictionRuleTest is a rule in Fillapix that checks if there is too many black cells at a certain cell, and I implemented the test case to verify that this rule is working correct. I used multiple JUnit tests. The first tested a 3x3 board with a 3 in the center and 4 surrounding black cells, which means there is too many black cells. I had another 3x3 board with a 1 in the corner and 3 surrounding black cells, so again too many black cells. I checked each location of the grid to confirm there were contradictions, which confirms that the rule works properly. I also added the test grids to the code. I manually created these test grids so I can test specific scenarios, and added these Fillapix grids to the project.
