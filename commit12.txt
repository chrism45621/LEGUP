12/12 commit: I added 3 different test grids for the Fillapix FinishWithBlackDirectRuleTest. Having 3 different test grids ensured I could properly check this rule in specific cases. I figured for this rule since it was unique in the way it added together cells, I would have multiple test grids. For the first grid, I made it a simple test. I only had 1 black cell, and the numbered cell was 1 to test that it works. The second test then had 4 black cells with one numbered cell as 4. The last test had all other 8 cells as black cells, and the one numbered cell was an 8. These were all 3x3 test grids. Having these amounts of test boards helped ensured that my code was working and the rule is correct.
