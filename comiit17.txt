I implemented 5 new Nurikabe puzzles. I figured I would do this to overall improve user experience. This commit will allow users to have more nurikabe puzzles, so they can test their skills with many different puzzles on this. To implement this, I understood how the Nurikabe puzzle worked. I went online and found out techniques to create different types of Nurikabe puzzles, so I did that. I then tested these puzzles on the Legup project, and they were all valid. I then committed these puzzles.
