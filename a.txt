11/11 commit: I implemented the BlackorWhiteCaseRuleTest for the Fillapix puzzle. I also implemented a custom test grid to test a specific scenario relevant to this case rule. This case rule checks if a cell can be either black or white at the certain state of the grid and creates 2 paths, one as black and one as white. My test case code just ensures that this rule works properly. First, I generated a valid Fillapix board. Then at a cell, I made sure it was able to execute the rule, and I made sure the 2 paths were the same except for the color. I then looped through each cell of the board. At each cell, I made sure that was valid based on the state of the grid. As a result of this, I was able to confirm that this case rule is correct.
